# Pay-Per-Click Landing Page (test)
A code test challenge to create a landing page for a fictitious company (_Quality Movers_).

**Project instructions can be found [here](INSTRUCTIONS.md)**

## Development

This assumes you have both [NPM](http://bower.io/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. If those are installed, run the following:

    $ git clone https://github.com/sambrannon/ppc-landing-page-test.git
    $ cd ppc-landing-page-test
    $ npm install

Make sure you start Gulp to process the SCSS changes.

    $ gulp sass:watch

Then serve up the site using [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

    $ http-server

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to see the site.
